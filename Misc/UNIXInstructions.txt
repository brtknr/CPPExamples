To run Ellipse.cpp on the mainframe:Create a folder on your 'H' drive, such as 'myprogs' - there must be no spaces in the name.Save Ellipse.cpp off the internet to 'myprogs' by right clicking and using save as 'all files' - otherwise Windows will put an unwanted .txt at the end of the file name.If you want to open Ellipse.cpp, use WordPad rather than NotePad since NotePad may not have linefeeds.Log into midge, mary or amos by going to the 'Run' command and typing 'telnet midge'. There are other terminal programs, but at least telnet has a scroll bar.Then type:cd myprogsCC Ellipse.cppcd myprogs moves you into the directory myprogs and CC Ellipse.cpp compiles the program.To run it type:a.outThis should produce a file Ellipse.dxf which can be opened using AutoCad, MicroStartion etc.You can use WordPad to modify the program. After saving the file go back to telnet and type:CC Ellipse.cppa.outTo move back to your root directory, just type:cdLisa Matthews has produced a very useful commentary on Ellipse.cpp - seewww.bath.ac.uk/~ab8lam/computing/c++.htmChris
