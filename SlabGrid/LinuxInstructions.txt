Open a Terminal Window.

Migrate to the folder containing the program using the cd command:

cd foldername
cd subfolder
etc.

cd on its own takes you back to the root directory.

The command:

ls

lists files and folders in the current folder. Use right mouse for copy and paste.

To compile type:

g++ SlabGrid.cpp -o ChrisProg -lm -lglut

To run type:

./ChrisProg

This works on the University of Bath Linux machines. On other machines you may have to install OpenGL.
